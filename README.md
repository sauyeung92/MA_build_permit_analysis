# MA_build_permit_analysis
This project aims to investigate the residential housing supply within the state of Massachusetts and how the supply rate has been affected due to COVID-19 restrictions. Data was obtained from the United States Census Bureau. THis data source was chosen because by analyzing permit applications, we can determine where future housing is planning on being constructed; this data is not typically listed on commerical real estate listing websites because the construction process has not begun yet.
